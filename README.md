🚀 Just Built Two Sleek Python Apps – Invoice Manager & Hotel Booking System! 🏨💻

Hey #LinkedIn community! 👋 I’m excited to share two interactive GUI applications I developed using Python + Tkinter – perfect examples of how powerful simplicity can be!

💡 Why These Projects?
I wanted to solve real-world problems with clean, user-friendly interfaces while mastering data persistence and CRUD operations. The result? Two fully functional systems ready for action!

📋 1. Invoice Management System (Your Digital Billing Assistant!)
✔ Add/Delete Invoices with auto-generated IDs
✔ Sort & Search effortlessly (by name, amount, or invoice #)
✔ Persistent Storage using JSON (no data loss!)
✔ Sleek Scrollable UI for large datasets

💬 Imagine automating small business billing in <100 lines of code!

🏨 2. Hotel Booking System (Front Desk in a Window!)
✔ Full Booking Management (check-in/out, room assignment)
✔ CSV Database with instant updates
✔ Edit/Delete Records on the fly
✔ Tabbed Interface for smooth navigation

💬 This could easily scale into a full PMS (Property Management System)!
